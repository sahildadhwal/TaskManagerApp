This project was created to refamiliarize myself with Swift and Xcode, particularly using SwiftUI for building user interfaces. It serves as a practical exercise to enhance my skills in iOS development by implementing a simple and functional task management application.

## Overview

The Task Manager app is a simple and intuitive to-do list application built using SwiftUI. It allows users to create, manage, and track tasks with various priorities and due dates. This app is designed to be user-friendly and visually appealing, making task management easy and efficient.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can add new tasks with a name, due date, and priority (High, Medium, Low).
- **View Tasks**: Tasks are displayed in a list, with the ability to mark them as completed.
- **Prioritize Tasks**: Tasks can be prioritized with color-coded labels (Red for High, Yellow for Medium, Green for Low).
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can delete tasks by swiping left on the task entry.
- **User Interface**: A clean and modern UI built with SwiftUI, following the latest design guidelines.
